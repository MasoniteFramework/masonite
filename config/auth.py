"""Authentication Model
Put the model here that will be used to authenticate users to your site.
Currently the model must contain a password field. In the model should
be an auth_column = 'column' in the Meta class. This column will be
used to verify credentials in the Auth facade or any other auth
classes. The auth_column will be used to change auth things
like 'email' to 'user' to easily switch which column will
be authenticated.
